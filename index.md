I am a PhD student in [Statistics](http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/) at University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by Sang-Yun Oh.

I am interested in developing robust and scalable learning algorithms for graphical models. I am inspired by how high-dimensional structures are often sparse and can be decomposed into smaller/simpler configurations.

Outside of academia, I enjoy surfing, listening to jazzy music, and learning foreign languages (I speak English, 今日本語をべんきゅうしています, Я не говорю по-русски).
